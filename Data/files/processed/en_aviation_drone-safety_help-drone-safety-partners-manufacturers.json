Wildfires and drones The airspace around and over a wildfire is closed to all aircraft, including drones, except those directly involved in fighting fires. While some emergency response teams use drones to fight wildfires, flying a drone over or near a wildfire without permission increases the risk that a firefighting aircraft will collide with the drone. If a drone is spotted in the area, emergency response teams need to ground their operations, which puts lives at risk. Canadian law requires all drone pilots to fly according to the Canadian Aviation Regulations , which state that only someone with permission can fly a drone over a wildfire, or within 9.3 kilometres (5 NM) of a wildfire. You could face serious penalties, including fines and/or jail time, if you break the rules. Before flying a drone in the summer months, make sure there are no smoke plumes or active wildfires nearby. Check local sources of information, such as the fire management agency website (English only) for your region, and NAV Drone, which provides real-time access to Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) and restricted airspace information.

Privacy guidelines for drone operators Recreational drone operators Before you fly your drone, understand the rules you must follow. Keep in mind the following privacy guidelines when operating recreational drones: Be responsible You’re in charge of any personal information your drone collects. Personal information includes: a person’s name, a photo of their face, or their licence plate. Limit the data you collect Don’t collect personal information you don’t need. Make sure any personal information you capture without consent can’t be identified. For example, blur faces or licence plates. Get permission If you’ll likely capture personal information on your flight, do your best to inform the people you film and get their permission. Store information securely If you save recordings that contain personal information, take steps so only you can access the information. Be open about what you’re doing If someone complains that your drone use is affecting their privacy, make sure to respond with respect and courtesy. Violating some parts of a person’s privacy could result in criminal charges relating to: voyeurism mischief creating a nuisance violations of provincial or municipal laws Commercial drone operators Businesses in Canada must follow the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) when using drones. Under PIPEDA, you must get consent to collect, use and share personal information with others. In order for consent to be valid, people must understand what they are agreeing to. Your business must handle people’s personal information professionally and with respect. This includes explaining why you need to collect personal information and giving people access to their personal information. You’re responsible for protecting and handling personal information throughout your business. Who doesn’t need to follow PIPEDA? PIPEDA doesn’t apply if your organization operates only within Alberta, British Columbia, or Quebec; however, other provincial privacy laws still apply. PIPEDA also doesn’t apply if you’re collecting, using, or sharing personal information for: journalism art books academic research not-for-profit organizations or charities Canada.ca/drone-safety Download Help us spread the word about drones and forest fires!
