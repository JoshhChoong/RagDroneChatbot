Search for your country’s Free Trade Agreement at Canada’s international trade and investment agreements , using Agreement Type: Free Trade Agreements Status: In force If a pilot wishes to operate a drone carrying cargo for monetary gain, the operator must have received an economic license from the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA).
