The new regulations allow medium-sized drone operations and some beyond the visual line-of-sight operations without the need for a Special Flight Operations Certificate (SFOC-RPAS). Canada’s expanded drone regulations introduce: New pilot and operator certification for lower-risk beyond visual line-of-sight operations Expanded privileges for advanced pilots to fly sheltered operations and extended visual line-of-sight (EVLOS) operations New rules for flying medium drones (over 25 kg up to 150 kg) within visual line-of-sight (VLOS) New technical standards for drones and any supporting systems flying advanced, complex or special flight operations New requirements for flying microdrones at advertised events New and updated fees for services provided by Transport Canada Two phases for coming into force The new regulations will come into force in two phases to give stakeholders time to get their appropriate training, certification, and to familiarize themselves with the new rules. You cannot start flying BVLOS, EVLOS, or Sheltered operations until November 4, 2025 . However, you will be able to take the new Level 1 Complex exam and apply for an RPAS Operator Certificate (RPOC) through the Drone Management Portal starting April 1, 2025 . This approach avoids changing operating rules during the peak summer flying season in 2025. If you want to fly these types of operations before November 4, you still need to apply for a Special Flight Operations Certificate. New and updated web pages and official publications (TPs, Standards, and Advisory Circulars) will be made available starting on April 1, 2025. Lower-risk beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS) The new regulations introduce a new pilot certification process for lower-risk BVLOS called Level 1 Complex Operations . To conduct lower-risk BVLOS, you must: Be at least 18 years old Pass the online exam for advanced and Level 1 Complex Operations Complete at least 20 hours of ground school and successfully pass a flight review Individuals, businesses, and organizations wishing to conduct BVLOS operations must have an RPAS Operator Certificate (RPOC). To obtain an RPOC, pilots, businesses, and organizations will be required to have policies and procedures in place that reflect the size and complexity of the operations they will carry out. Where you will be able to fly BVLOS All lower-risk BVLOS operations must remain in uncontrolled airspace stay below 122 metres (400 feet) stay away from airports and aerodromes If you are flying a small or medium drone, you may operate at least 1 km away from a populated area. If you are flying a small drone, you may also operate over a sparsely populated area or less than 1 km from a populated area. Expanding privileges for Advanced Pilot Certificates As of November 4, 2025, the following drone operations will be permitted for pilots with a Pilot Certificate – Advanced Operations: Sheltered operations Extended visual line-of-sight (EVLOS) operations Medium drones within VLOS If you already hold a Pilot Certificate – Advanced Operations today, you do not need to re-apply for your certificate, however you do need to familiarize yourself with the new operating rules. And make sure you keep your certificate current! Sheltered operations Sheltered operations are flights with a small drone that are close to a structure, such as a building. To conduct sheltered operations, you must fly the drone: More than 30 metres (100 feet) away from people not involved in the operation No greater than 30 metres (100 feet) above the structure Less than 61 metres (200 feet) horizontally from the structure Extended visual line-of-sight (EVLOS) operations EVLOS operations are short-range flights with a small drone, but where the drone is far away enough from the pilot that it cannot be seen by an unaided eye. To conduct EVLOS, you must: Remain in uncontrolled airspace Fly more than 30 metres (100 feet) away from people not involved in the operation Receive assistance from a trained Visual Observer (VO) holding an RPA pilot certificate Fly the drone within 2 nautical miles (3.6 km) of yourself, the VO and the Control Station Medium drones within VLOS To fly your medium drone within VLOS , the drone must be declared as safe and able to perform the specific advanced operations that you want to conduct. You can fly medium drones in uncontrolled airspace or in controlled airspace with permission from air traffic control. New requirements for microdrones at advertised events As of April 1, 2025, an SFOC will now be required to fly microdrones at advertised events . New and updated service fees for services provided by Transport Canada Introducing fees for new exams, certificates, and declarations. Service New Fee Level 1 Complex Operations Exam $50 Pilot Certificate – Level 1 Complex Operations $125 Pre-Validated Declarations $1,200 RPAS Operator Certificate (RPOC) $125 As of November 4, 2025, anyone applying for an SFOC-RPAS will need to pay a fee, except for government organizations involved with emergency response. These operations include higher altitude flights, operations at an advertised event, and flying a drone that weighs more than 150 kg. Service New Fee SFOC – Very Low complexity $20 SFOC – Low complexity $75 SFOC – Medium complexity $900 SFOC – High Complexity $2,000 As of April 1, 2025, drone registration fees will increase to . Useful terms to know Populated area means an area with more than five people per square kilometre. Sparsely populated area means an area with more than 5 but not more than 25 people per square kilometre. Visual Observer (VO) means a crew member who is trained to assist the pilot in ensuring the safe conduct of a flight. Advertised event means an outdoor event that is advertised to the public, like a concert, festival, market or sporting event.
