If you build or modify Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), RPAS components or configurable elements, you can make a declaration to Transport Canada identifying the capabilities of the system. Anyone who builds or modifies a drone must be able to prove that the RPAS complies with Canadian Aviation Regulations section 901.194 and Standard 922 if it is to be used for Advanced or Level 1 Complex operations. If a drone model does not have an RPAS Safety Assurance Declaration, drone pilots cannot use that drone for Advanced or Level 1 Complex operations. For more information on how an RPAS safety assurance affects how pilots can fly a drone, see choosing the right drone for you . Pilots might also need to use drones with a Safety Assurance if they want to apply for a Special Flight Operations Certificate. Pre-Validated Declaration (PVD) Certain operations require a higher level of safety assurance. The Safety Assurance Declaration must be pre-validated by Transport Canada before the applicant submits their declarations. You must apply for a Pre-Validated Declaration if your RPAS or configurable element is intended for flying a medium RPAS (25 kg to 150 kg) VLOS near people: less than 152.5 m (500 ft) but not less than 30 m (100 ft) from people medium RPAS (25 kg to 150 kg) VLOS over people: less than 30 m (100 ft) from people small RPAS (250 g to 25 kg) BVLOS in uncontrolled airspace and over a sparsely populated area or less than 1 km from a populated area Who can submit a declaration The designer and/or manufacturer of a drone or configurable element Third-party drone modifiers Individuals who design and build “home-built” drones About the RPAS safety assurance declaration You can declare that your RPAS complies with any or all sections of Standard 922 . 922.04 - Operations in Controlled Airspace 922.05 - Operations near People 922.06 - Operations over People 922.07 - Safety and Reliability 922.08 - Containment 922.09 - Command and Control Link Reliability and Lost Link Behaviour 922.10 - Detect Alert and Avoid Systems 922.11 - Control Station Design 922.12 - Demonstrated Environmental Envelope How to comply Manufacturers are accountable to perform the necessary tests, evaluations, and/or assessments and recording the results. Advisory Circular AC 922-001: Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems Safety Assurance outlines the safety assurance process to guide manufacturers with developing the necessary evidence to substantiate their declarations. Advisory Circular AC 901-001: Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems Safety Assurance Declaration and Pre-Validated Declaration Processes provides guidance on the Declaration and Pre-Validated Declaration processes. Configurable elements Adding a configurable element to a non-compliant drone can help it meet the safety requirements for advanced or complex operations. A configurable element can include: a deployable parachute a more robust C2 link a Detect and Avoid (DAA) system Submit a Safety Assurance Declaration Apply for a Pre-Validated Declaration Fees and service standards Service Fee Service standard Processing a Pre-Validated Declaration 60 working days Submitting a Safety Assurance Declaration Free 5 working days to be listed Penalties We may fine you if you falsely declare to meet the technical requirements set out in Standard 922 — RPAS Safety Assurance. You may be fined $3,000 for a person and $15,000 for a corporation for each registered system. What you need to know before you make a Declaration You do not need to submit the results of the AC 922-001 Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems Safety Assurance verification tests along with your declaration of RPAS Safety Assurance. However, you may be asked to produce the results of verification tests later. Failure to produce the results of verification tests when requested may impact the declaration status of your RPAS. After you declare Once you submit your declaration, it will be reviewed and we will contact you if more information is needed or if the declaration is accepted. It may take 5 business days or more following acceptance of your declaration for it to appear in the list of drones eligible for advanced operations . You are responsible for ensuring all contact information remains current and valid. Invalid contact information may result in the declaration being considered invalid.
